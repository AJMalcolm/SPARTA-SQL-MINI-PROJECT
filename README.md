# SPARTA-SQL-MINI-PROJECT
A short SQL Practice Project

During my second week at Sparta Global the focus of my learning was on basic SQL.
I was given a 'mini project' to cover the content of the sylabus based upon a serious of query instructions.
These questions (along with the mark scheme) and my work can be found in this repository.
